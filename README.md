<h3> IBM DS course </h3>

<h4> data_collection_api = Data collection proecess using REST API </h4>
<h4> data_collection_web_scraping = Data collection proecess using web scraping method </h4>
<h4> data_wrangling = There are several different cases where booster did not land successfully. sometimes, landing was attempted but failed due to accident. 
Based on the different outcomes, we classify them as good or bad outcome and convert those outcomes into training labels with 1 as successfully landed, 0 means landing was unsuccessful. </h4>
<h4> Data_preparation_and_feature_engineering = Here, EDA is done with data visualization. Data is prepared for the classification model by performing the onehot encoding function on dataset. </h4>
<h4> EDA-with_SQL = EDA is done on the datast using SQL commands using SQL server. </h4>
<h4> interactive_visual_analytics = Interactive maps are build using folium library in python. To check whether launch sites are in proximity to railways, highways, etc
and othre facilities. </h4> 
<h4> spacex_dash_app = Dashboard is created with plotly library, showing pie chart which tells about success rate and scatter plot which tells about tha launch outcomes with payload mass that we will selct the range of the payload mass through slider. </h4>
<h4> spacex_Machine Learning Prediction = here, we have trained few classification models on the dataset and selcted the one with more accuracy. </h4>
